## Why and When?

Using an old WiFi router as an extender can be a cost-effective solution for extending the range of your wireless network. There are a few reasons why someone might consider doing this.

Firstly, if you have a large home or office with multiple floors, you may find that your wireless signal is weak or non-existent in certain areas. Rather than buying a new extender, you can use an old router that you already have to boost your signal and extend your network's coverage.

Secondly, if you have upgraded to a new router but don't want to get rid of your old one, you can repurpose it as an extender. This is a great way to make use of an old device and save money on buying a new extender.

Lastly, using an old router as an extender can also improve the overall speed and performance of your wireless network. By extending the coverage of your network, you can reduce the number of dead spots and interference areas, which can improve the overall performance of your network.

## How?

### Step 1

Reset the old router and connect your computer to the TP-Link router using an Ethernet cable. Please use the LAN port on the router to connect to your computer. Then open a web browser and enter the default IP address of the router in the address bar. The default IP address is usually 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1. You can google your router's default configuration or it might be mentioned behind your router.

### Step 2

Enter the username and password to access the router's settings. The default username and password are usually "admin" and "admin" respectively. If you have changed the login credentials before, use the ones you set up.

### Step 3

It is very possible that your old router and the new (main) router's default IP address can be the same. So go to the Network tab and select the LAN option. Change the IP address to something else like 192.168.0.210 (you can use any other available IP on the network) and save the setting.

The router will disconnect and reload on the new IP address i.e. 192.168.0.210. If it does not reload automatically, then please enter the IP address on the web browser manually.

### Step 4

Go to DHCP settings and disable the DHCP server and save your settings.

> You can also set up your Wireless 2.4GHz and 5GHz settings after this.

### Step 5

Now connect your old router with the new router using the LAN ports.

### Step 6

Now you should be able to connect your devices to the old router WiFi and LAN port to access the Internet.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, using an old WiFi router as an extender is a cost-effective solution for extending the range of your wireless network. By repurposing an old router that you may already have, you can save money on buying a new extender and also improve the overall performance of your wireless network. However, it's important to note that not all routers are suitable for use as an extender. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can easily configure your old router as an extender and enjoy better coverage and improved performance for your wireless network.
